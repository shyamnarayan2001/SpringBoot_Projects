# Objective:

The objective of this project is to understand the usage of Spring 5's WebClient and WebTestClient API's to consume the GitHub API's and to perform CRUD operations on userâ€™s Github Repositories.

# Pre-requsites:
The following softwares are to be installed on your machine for this code to work:
* JDK 11 or Open JDK 11
* Maven

# Instructions for the setup:

* Git clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/shyamnarayan2001/SpringBoot_Reactive_Projects.git
```
* Once the clone is complete, you will see the sub-folder `/spring-webclient-demo` under the parent folder `/SpringBoot_Reactive_Projects`
* The source for this project can be found in the path `SpringBoot_Reactive_Projects/spring-webclient-demo`
* Create a personal access token on Github - `https://github.com/settings/tokens`
* Open `src/main/resources/application.properties` and specify your github username in `app.github.username` property, and your personal access token in `app.github.token` property.
* Now open Windows Command prompt OR Bash and go to the sub-directory path (`SpringBoot_Reactive_Projects/spring-webclient-demo`) and run the following command, which will start the application
```
mvnw clean install && java -jar target/spring-webclient-demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

Alternatively, you can run the app without packaging it using -
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
* The server will start at `http://localhost:8080`.

# Exploring the Rest APIs:

* The application defines following REST APIs
```
1. GET /repos - Get all the Github Repositories

2. POST /repos - Create a new Github Repository

3. GET /repos/{repo} - Retrieve a Repository by providing repository name

4. PATCH /repos/{repo} - Update a Repository

5. DELETE /repos/{repo} - Delete a Repository

``` 
# Running integration tests:

* The project also contains integration tests for all the Rest APIs. For running the integration tests, go to the root directory path (SpringBoot_Reactive_Projects/spring-webclient-demo) of the project and type the following in your terminal.
``` 
mvn test
```
